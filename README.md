## About the project

Just a little project I spent a few evenings messing around on to see how far I could take ChatGPT and how easy it would be to make a game purely from generated code.
I was also comparing the responses from ChatGPT3 and ChatGPT4.
I tried to create the init games with the most basic rules using a single prompt. When I had the basic game in place I then crafted additional promots to generate code for more specific features which I think handled reasonably well.
Overall this is not a very serious project or a show of skill but I wanted to add it as I thought the actual outcome was interesting and the process was insightful.
